# CSE 150: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence: Search and Reasoning Assignment 1

Project Overview: The goal of this assignment is to guide the Pacman agent through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. To achieve this, multiple different general search algorithms were used for different Pacman scenarios. The algorithms implemented in the assignment are: Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search, A* Search. These algorithms were used to find all the corners, eating all the dots, create a suboptimal serach by greedily eating the closest dot, etc. My portion of the code can be found in search.py and searchAgents.py in spots labeled "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***". The rest of the files and code was provided to complete the assigment.

A complete description of the assignment can be found in Assignment1_150_fall16.pdf
